# Type-driven design example in Python

In his post [Parse, donâ€™t validate](ttps://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/),
Alexis King states that using type-driven design you can improve your code and make sure your input is always what your functions require.

Since Python is not strongly typed, how can we use type-driven design to help us improve our code?
I will show an example where using [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) with clean code practices can help us write maintainable, easy to use code.

This is a very simple example.

Do not use in production, if you do not have to.
